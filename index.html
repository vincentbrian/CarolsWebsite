      <!-- <h1>Hi! I'm Carol</h1>
      <p>Get to know me and the love I have for animals</p> -->
      <p class="bio">  Hi, my name is Carol and I would like to tell you a little about myself.
I have always loved animals all my life.  Growing up I wasn’t allowed to have a dog or a cat so I would
go to a friends house and spend time with my friend and their dog.  I got my first dog
when I was in my twenties. He was a toy poodle puppy. Was so small that he couldn’t
get out of the box like his brothers and sisters.  He was very smart and lived to 17.</p>
    <p class="bio"> My second dog was Pomeranian that I rescued and was about six years old.  His
name was Cinci. The person gave him up because he had liver issues.  He was in and out
of the vets for the liver for about five years until I had to say goodbye to him.</p>
  <p class="bio">   My third and present dog is another rescue dog.  He was taken from a horder who
had 10 kinds of big and small dogs and he would have to fight for food.  He is still comes to work with me everyday.</p>
  <p class="bio">   I also had a dog that even though she belonged to the person that I worked for back
Then I have always loved her like she was one of my own.  She was a Bichon and
her name was Snuggles.  AKA the Snugs.
</p>
<p class="bio">It has now been 16yrs. Since I started my dog walking business. I love working with animals and hope to continue doing so for as long as I can.
